# Cardiotoxicity
Drug-induced cardiotoxicity represents a significant risk to patients, particularly when it results in lasting harm to the heart muscle. To mitigate risks and enhance treatment outcomes, combination therapies have gained attraction, offering the promise of increased efficacy, and reduced toxicity, with the underlying rationale of reducing required drug concentrations of individual drugs and poly-pharmacological effects. In this study, we proposed a systematic workflow aimed at detecting the favorable effect of combination therapies on cardiotoxicity, leveraging the data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), a valuable resource that compiles real-world, spontaneous reports of adverse drug events. This file shows the results of this study.
